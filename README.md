## Parker UI on iOS

This is a simple iOS app for experimenting with the swiftUI library

Project contains examples of:

- View transitions with animations
- Building views with stacks, buttons, text and custom sub views
- State variables
- Binding variables
- Image importing
- Extending UI elements with custom styles

## How to run

- clone the repo
- open it with xcode
- select a simulation target (I used iPhone 13)
- click play in the top left corner
